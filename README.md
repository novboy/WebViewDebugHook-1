# WebViewDebugHook

From [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging) we can use blow code to debugging webview on android 4.4+.

```java
    WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
```
But the most app are third parties, webview debugging is disabled. WebViewDebugHook can force app to debugging.

## Requirement

- Android 4.4+

- Rooted device

- Installed [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer)

## Note

- libs/XposedBridgeApi-XX.jar should not build to app file.

- Tencent QQ use it's X5 kernel, and could not debugging. We can make a file named `debug.conf` with blow content in the root directory to force it use webview.

```ini
    result_QProxy=false
    result_systemWebviewForceUsed=true
    setting_forceUseSystemWebview=true
```

## Question

- What is Xposed ?

Xposed is a framework for modules that can change the behavior of the system and apps without touching any APKs. That's great because it means that modules can work for different versions and even ROMs without any changes (as long as the original code was not changed too much). It's also easy to undo. As all changes are done in the memory, you just need to deactivate the module and reboot to get your original system back. There are many other advantages, but here is just one more: Multiple modules can do changes to the same part of the system or app. With modified APKs, you to decide for one. No way to combine them, unless the author builds multiple APKs with different combinations.
